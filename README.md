# Category Theory Notes
Cleaned up personal notes on category theory. Following primarily Emily Riehl's _Category Theory in Context_.

## Prerequisites
Should have some abstract algebra and topology background to start. Functional programming can be helpful, but after a certain point you need to have a certain level of mathematical sophistication to continue.

## Installation 
Include `blubase.sty` and `blubird.sty` (you can find these in my blubird repo) in the same directory as `category.tex` to compile this locally. 

## Sections (following Riehl)
### Chapter 1: Basics

### Chapter 2: Representability, Yoneda, Universality

### Chapter 3: Limits and Colimits

### (more to be added later)
